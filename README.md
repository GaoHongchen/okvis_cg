> **OKVIS(Open Keyframe-based Visual-Inertial SLAM) tracks the motion of an assembly of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) plus N cameras (tested: mono, stereo and four-camera setup) and reconstructs the scene sparsely.** This is the Author’s implementation of the [1] and [3] with more results in [2]. There is currently no loop-closure detection / optimisation included, but we are working on it.
